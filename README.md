# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Overview  
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using data analytics techniques. The process involves loading and exploring the dataset in Python, managing data through SQL Server, building interactive dashboards in Power BI, and creating a final report and presentation using Gamma.

## Dataset  
The analysis uses a detailed dataset containing transactional customer shopping records, including purchase dates, product categories, quantities, and prices. This data supports a comprehensive study of purchase patterns, customer segmentation, and trend insights.

## Tools  
- **Python:** For data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis  
- **SQL Server:** For efficient data storage and querying of transactional data  
- **Power BI:** To create interactive dashboards for visual insights and stakeholder communication  
- **Gamma:** Used to develop a professional project presentation summarizing the findings and recommendations  

## Setup  
- Load the dataset (CSV format) into Python using Pandas for initial preprocessing.  
- Import cleaned data into SQL Server for advanced querying and aggregation.  
- Connect Power BI to SQL Server to build visual dashboards.  
- Use Gamma to prepare the final presentation slides.

## Dashboard  
The Power BI dashboard provides dynamic views of customer behavior metrics such as purchase frequency, average order value, and customer segmentation clusters. Features include filters by product category and time period, enabling interactive exploration of key business insights.

## Results  
Key findings reveal distinct customer segments driving revenue, seasonal trends in purchases, and opportunities for targeted marketing interventions. Visualizations and data-driven insights help guide strategic decisions to enhance customer retention and increase sales.

## How to Run  
1. Clone or download the project files.  
2. Install necessary Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.).  
3. Run the Python scripts to preprocess data and prepare SQL-compatible files.  
4. Load data into SQL Server using provided SQL scripts.  
5. Open Power BI dashboard file and connect it to your SQL Server database.  
6. Explore the dashboard for insights or customize visuals as needed.  
7. Use Gamma presentation file to review or present project findings.
